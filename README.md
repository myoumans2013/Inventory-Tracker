# Inventory-Tracker
A basic Java app for managing an inventory through adding and removing items. The program is not perfect, but it will improve over time.


This is my first basic script for inventory management. It uses an ArrayList to store, remove, and list items. 


In the future, I aim to create more advanced programs using certain data structures and objects.
